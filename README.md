# Health Data Calculator

A Java application designed to calculate and manage health metrics based on patient data. This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (CST8284) course at Algonquin College.

## Project Overview

This system helps healthcare providers to:
- Calculate key health indicators including BMI and heart rates
- Collect and store essential patient information
- Generate comprehensive health data reports
- Validate health calculations through testing

## Features

- Patient data management including:
 - Personal information (name, gender)
 - Physical measurements (height, weight)
 - Birth year and age calculations
- Health metrics calculations:
 - Body Mass Index (BMI)
 - Maximum heart rate
 - Target heart rate ranges
- Data validation and error checking
- JUnit test suite for calculation verification

## Technical Implementation
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Inheritance structure
- Complete Javadoc documentation
- JUnit testing framework
- Input validation
- Error handling

## Core Calculations
- BMI calculation with weight and height inputs
- Heart rate calculations:
  - Maximum heart rate (220 - age)
  - Target heart rate range (50%-85% of maximum)
- Age calculation from birth year
